This is a simple class for doing some tiltshift on any picture.
Just instantiate a new Tiltshift object with your arguments.
Here is a simple example :

You can load any asset from your library
var image:Asset_image = new Asset_image(535, 302);

var myImage:Tiltshift = new Tiltshift(0.5,0.5,5,-40,"asset",image);

or with an url
var myImage2:Tiltshift = new Tiltshift(0.5,0.5,5,-40,"url",'./assets/image.jpg');


Constructor works like this : 


new Tiltshift(size of focal,position of focal on the image, blur value, angle, image type(url or asset), asset or url);

Enjoy !
